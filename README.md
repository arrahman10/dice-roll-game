# üé≤ Dice Roll Game

A simple and fun cross-platform **Flutter** application that simulates the classic dice-rolling experience.  
This project demonstrates practical Flutter concepts like **stateful widgets**, **image rendering**, **random number generation**, and **game-state transitions** using enums ‚Äî all structured with clean code and Git-based version control best practices.

## üîß Development Notes

- **Project Type:** Flutter mobile app (single-screen gameplay with conditional navigation)
- **Architecture:** Simple layered structure with clear separation of concerns:
    - `screens/` ‚Äì UI screens like GamePage and StartPage
    - `widgets/` ‚Äì Reusable UI components (e.g., DiceButton)
    - `constants/` ‚Äì Game rules and text constants
    - `models/` ‚Äì Enum model for managing game state (GameStatus)
    - `utils/` ‚Äì Helper for loading image paths

- **Environment:**
    - Flutter SDK: ‚â• 3.22
    - Dart SDK: ^3.9.2
    - App Version: 1.0.0+1
    - Publish Status: Private (`publish_to: none`)

- **Font Customization:**  
  Applied the `RussoOne` font globally using the `google_fonts` package to ensure visual consistency.

- **State Management:**  
  Basic `setState()` used to control UI updates and game logic. Controlled via:
    - `GameStatus` enum (none, running, over)
    - Flags like `hasTarget`, `shouldShowBoard`, and variables like `diceSum`, `result`, `target`

- **Random Logic:**  
  Used `Random.secure()` for stronger randomness when generating dice outcomes.

- **UI Conditions:**
    - Buttons (ROLL / RESET) are conditionally rendered based on game state.
    - StartPage and GamePage toggle via `shouldShowBoard`.

- **Image & Asset Handling:**  
  Dice face images (`d1.png` to `d6.png`) and `logo.png` are stored under `assets/images/`.  
  Instructional screenshots placed in `assets/screenshots/` for documentation.

- **Dialogs:**  
  Instruction popup created using `AlertDialog` with rich multiline content pulled from `game_rules.dart`.

- **Development Flow:**  
  Followed incremental commits with:
    - Proper semantic prefixes (`init:`, `feat:`, `style:`)
    - Clean commit history
    - Clear and structured descriptions for each change

- **Editor:**  
  Developed and tested using **Android Studio** with real device deployment for UI validation.

- **Testing Scope:**
    - Manual UI tests performed on Android device.
    - Functional testing includes win/lose scenarios and game state resets.

- **Limitations:**
    - No automated tests
    - No persistent storage or high-score tracking
    - UI optimized for mobile portrait view only
